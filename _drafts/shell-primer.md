A shell is a way to interact with your computer. you type in text commands at a _command line_, and the shell interprets them


wtf is a filesystem.

how do you move around the file system?

cd for change directory.

cd . and cd .. and cd ~ are special. cd by itself is like cd ~

how about cd - that's a special trick!

ls

touch maybe

what a file _is_

editor - subl nano vim emacs
mac osx 'open' will launch whatever the default handler is

man

running a program.
ruby python node php
