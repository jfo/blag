<h1>This is the about page</h1>
<p>My name is Jeff Fowler. I live in New York City.</p>
<p>I'm trying to write more here. All the .coms were taken. 'jfo' is my irc handle.</p>
<p>I also make <a href="http://music.jfo.click">music</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffowler" target="_blank">@jeffowler</a></p>
<p>Email: <a href="mailto:jeffowler@gmail.com" target="_blank">jeffowler@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>RSS: <a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank">blog.jfo.click/feed</a></p>
<p>To recruiters: I don't mind getting emails, but I'm not looking right now and I am very unlikely to respond to anything unsolicited unless I'm curious about what you're working on or I know someone who might be a good fit.</p>
